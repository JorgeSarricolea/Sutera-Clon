This (unfinished) clone of the Sutera website, created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Description
The Sutera-Clon project is an ongoing attempt to recreate the original Sutera website, using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was started as part of a technical assessment, but due to time constraints, it is currently unfinished.

## Features
Some of the key features of this project include:

- A responsive and modern user interface that closely resembles the original Sutera website.
- Custom-made CSS styles and Vanilla JavaScript code that mimic the behavior of the original website.
